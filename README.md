# Master_Thesis_Data
These are scripts and data related to our master thesis concerning the representational style of Danish politicians. 

The thesis is based on data from different sources. We have made the following data publically available:
1. Data from Facebook Ad Library combined with Danish election data. This is the file called "FB_VOTE_final".
2. Raw data from our conjoint experiment. This is the file called "Conjoint_Data". 

In addition to this, we have uploaded our scripts. They contain all of the coding that has been used to conduct our analysis.
The scripts are numbered according to the order that they should be run. Scripts related to the first part of our analysis which
is based on Facebook data are called "Part_I". Scripts related to the second part of our analysis which is based on our conjoint
experiment are called "Part_II". 

For questions or general comments, please feel free to get in touch.
