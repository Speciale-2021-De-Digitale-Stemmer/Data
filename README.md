# Master_Thesis_Data
These are scripts and data related to our master thesis concerning the representational style of Danish politicians. 

The thesis is based on data from different sources. We have made the following data publically available:
1. Data from Facebook Ad Library combined with Danish election data. This is the file called "FB_VOTE_final".
2. Raw data from our conjoint experiment. This is the file called "Conjoint_Data". 

In addition to this, we have uploaded our scripts. They contain all of the coding that has been used to conduct our analysis. 

For questions or general comments, please feel free to get in touch.
